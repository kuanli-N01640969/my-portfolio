    <h2>This is my Bio!</h2>

    <section>
        <div class="box2">
            I’m a foodie at heart, and coming from an international background I’ve found that the best way to connect
            with people across cultures is through food. That passion even sparked a knife collection...you could say
            I’ve really sharpened that hobby over time. Professionally, I’ve worked in supply chain and e-commerce,
            building skills in operations, analysis, and problem-solving. With my background in chemistry, I’m now
            diving into data science and exploring how AI and machine learning can be used to solve real-world
            challenges.
